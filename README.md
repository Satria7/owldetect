# OwlDetect

`OwlDetect` is a startup that want to fight plagiarism in education sector.

They want to create a web app that can be used by highschool teachers to check plagiarism in their students homework.

Plagiarism in highschool is mostly not complicated, usually what they do is fall into one of following category:

1. They will copy the exact phrases from others homework
2. They will copy then alter some words in the copied phrases
3. They will copy only some phrases

In this repo you will find prototype for their web app. However it is not yet working as they expected because it could only check for the exact match text. So if its differ even if only a bit, it would not categorized as plagiarism. 

You could see the live version of this web app [here](https://dry-woodland-18779.herokuapp.com/).
